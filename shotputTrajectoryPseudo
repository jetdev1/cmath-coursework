pseudo code for projecting trajectory of a shot put

objects:
shotPut: holds data for the current state of the shot put based on time
time elapsed, angle of release, release force(constant), current velocity,
acceleration(calculated using 2 sec intervals)


list of functions:
plotGraph(): accept list of coordinates, plots and shows them.

updateState(): updates the state of the shotPut based on the time elapsed

calcDrag(): calculates drag based on the current velocity

generateCoordinates(): generates the position of the shotPut based
on the state of the shot put
a = F/m (by drag)
a * t = change in vel
average vel = currentVelocity += (change in vel / 2)
d = average vel * t
rise = d * sin(releaseAngle)
run = d * cos(releaseAngle)

y += rise
x += run


main(): executes entire program using above functions, looping them by
increasing the elapsedTime value by 0.5s each loop

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
def main():
iterate through angles 0(upright) through 90
create an instance of shotPut each time
add each instance into a list

iterating through each shotput:
check if shotput has reached the ground yet
if still in air:
increase time value in 0.5 second intervals
