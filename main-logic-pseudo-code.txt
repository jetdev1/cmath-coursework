start loop with the current velocity

calculate drag on the y axis based on current y velocity
calculate deceleration caused by drag
calculate and update new y velocity (solely for the calculation of drag of the next loop)

calculate drag on the x axis based on the current x velocity
calculate deceleration caused by drag
calculate and update new x velocity (solely for the calculation of drag of the next loop)

calculate displacement on both axes based on acceleration inclusive of drag
update coordinates of the shotPut
add new coordinates into list of coordinates to be plotted
